# Smart Translator Pen  

A compact and intelligent pen that translates written text or Braille input into spoken language.  
Built using an **ESP32 microcontroller**, it combines sensors, connectivity, and a speaker to make translation easy and accessible.  

## ðŸ”¹ Features  
- Detects **text or Braille input** using a tip sensor  
- Translates in real time with the **ESP32**  
- Outputs speech through a **speaker**  
- Supports **Wi-Fi/Bluetooth** connectivity  
- Powered by a **rechargeable battery**  

## ðŸ”¹ Components  
- **ESP32 Microcontroller** â€“ translation and control  
- **Tip Sensor** â€“ captures input  
- **Speaker** â€“ outputs translated speech  
- **Connectivity Module** â€“ Wi-Fi/Bluetooth  
- **Battery and Power Unit** â€“ supplies stable power  

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works  
1. The user writes or scans text/Braille using the pen tip  
2. The **tip sensor** captures input and sends it to the **ESP32**  
3. The ESP32 translates the text in real time  
4. The **speaker** outputs the translated result  

## ðŸ”¹ Applications  
- Assistive device for the visually impaired  
- Real-time language translation tool  
- Educational and accessibility technology  

## ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements  
- Add support for multiple languages  
- Enhance speech clarity  
- Optimize hardware for portability
